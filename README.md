# Intro-To-Self-Driving-Cars 

In this nanodegree program you will learn the essential skills required to build a self-driving car. You will solve problems in C++ and Python related to self-driving cars. 

# Course 1: Bayesian Thinking

Bayesian thinking involves the mathematical framework that underlies a self-driving car's understanding of itself and the world around it. This course presents the localization methodology used by the self-driving car to accurately estimate of its location in the world.

# Course 3: C++ Basics

This course introduces the usage of C++ in self-driving cars. The project involves the translation of a given program written in Python into C++.

Projects:
Project-3-Translate Python to C++

# Course 4: Performance Programming in C++

This course focuses on how to write good code that runs correctly. Primary focus is made on the low level language features of C++ which can make C++ fast.

Projects:
Project-4-Optimize-Histogram Filter
