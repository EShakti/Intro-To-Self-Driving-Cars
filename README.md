# Intro-To-Self-Driving-Cars 

In this nanodegree program you will learn the essential skills required to build a self-driving car. You will solve problems in C++ and Python related to self-driving cars. 

# Course 1: Bayesian Thinking

Bayesian thinking involves the mathematical framework that underlies a self-driving car's understanding of itself and the world around it. This course presents the localization methodology used by the self-driving car to accurately estimate of its location in the world.

# Course 3: C++ Basics

This course introduces the usage of C++ in self-driving cars. The project involves the translation of a given program written in Python into C++.

Projects:
Project-3-Translate Python to C++

# Course 4: Performance Programming in C++

This course focuses on how to write good code that runs correctly. Primary focus is made on the low level language features of C++ which can make C++ fast.

Projects:
Project-4-Optimize-Histogram Filter

# Course 5: Navigating Complex Data Structures

Navigating Complex Data Structures involves the algorithm implementation based on Algorithmic thinking that show up most frequently in self-driving cars.

Projects:
Project-5-Planning an Optimal Path

# Course 6: Visualizing Calculus and Controls

You will learn the basics of calculus, the mathematics of continuity. Also, you will learn to use some of Python's most popular visualization libraries.

Projects:
Project-6-Trajectory Visualizer

# Course 7: Machine Learning and Computer Vision

In this course, you will learn how a computer sees an image and how we can use machine learning to teach a computer to identify images programmatically.

Projects:
Project-7-Image Classifier from Scratch
