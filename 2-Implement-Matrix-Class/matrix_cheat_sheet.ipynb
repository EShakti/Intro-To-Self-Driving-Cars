    "* **Scalar** - A scalar is just a number like 1.2, -5, 0, or 239. When we use the word **scalar** it's usually to highlight that we are *not* talking about a **vector** or a **matrix**. \n",
    "* **Matrix** - A matrix is a rectangular grid of numbers. For example, this is a matrix with  **2 rows** and **3 columns** so we would call it a $2\\times 3$ \"2 by 3\" matrix.:\n",

    "$$\\begin{bmatrix}1.5 & -9.2 & 0 \\\\\n",
    "5.4 & 7 & 2.2\\end{bmatrix}$$\n",

    "* **Row / Column** - These terms describe the horizontal (row) and vertical (column) sequences of numbers in a matrix. For example, the first row in the matrix above is $\\begin{bmatrix}1.5 & -9.2 & 0\\end{bmatrix}$.\n",
    "* **Vector** - A vector is a matrix where either the width or the height is 1. When the height is 1, it's called a **row vector**. When the width is 1 it's called a **column vector**.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Matrix Element** - The **element** in the first row and first column of the matrix given above is the number $1.5$\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Square Matrix** - A matrix is square when its height is equal to its width.\n",
    "* **Main Diagonal** - The main diagonal of a **square matrix** is the sequence of **elements** from the top left to bottom right. For the matrix below the main diagonal refers to the numbers 2 and 6.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\begin{bmatrix}2 & 9 \\\\ -4 & 6 \\end{bmatrix} $$\n",
    "* **Identity Matrix** - This is a special **square matrix** where all of the **elements** are equal to zero except those on the **main diagonal**, which are equal to 1. This is a $3\\times 3$ identity matrix:\n",

    "\n",
    "The numbers $i$ and $j$ are used to refer to the row number and column number of a matrix (respectively). \n",
    "\n",
    "**NOTE**: The top left element of a matrix is typically given by $\\mathbf{A}_{11}$ and **not** $\\mathbf{A}_{00}$.**"
